Hi, I have completed Atıl Samancıoğlu's iOS programming training. During this time, I will upload the applications I have developed to my repo. I used CoreData, CoreLocation, MapKit in this project. I can save a location that I want to be in the future and start the navigation when I want to reach that location.
